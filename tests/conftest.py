"""Shared pytest configuration.

The integration tests under ``tests/integration`` boot a real ColdFront
instance and therefore need the ``integration`` dependency group
(``uv sync --group integration``). Without it, they are skipped at collection
time so that plain ``uv run pytest`` keeps working with just the dev group.
